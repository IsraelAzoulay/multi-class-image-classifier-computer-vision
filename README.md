# DishVision: Computer Vision Multi-Class Image Classifier
This repository houses an advanced project focused on classifying images of three distinct types of food using cutting-edge deep learning and computer vision techniques. The project leverages transfer learning with PyTorch to achieve an impressive accuracy of **96+%** on the test set. Additionally, it includes a detailed replication of the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture from a prominent machine learning research paper, showcasing both the potential and challenges of this advanced approach. The implementation is executed on Google Colab for efficient computation and easy accessibility. The optimal model has been deployed on Hugging Face as an interactive app and can be accessed [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/IsraelAzoulay/DishVision).
